<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I live in Spain for the last 15 years. Tried to find my place here for the most time of being here. Made friends, lost friends, found love, lost love.</p>

<p>I was a fresh graduate in IT technologies when I moved in. At first I didn't know tha language, then I missed the oportunity to legaly confirm my degree. All this led to a dark period of my past. Hopefuly with this course I can get on the right path</p>
